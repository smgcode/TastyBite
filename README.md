Tasty Bite

#### Food blog agrigator to share and discover new food

#### Description
Tasty Bite is a clone of tastespotting.com using Ruby on Rails with the majority of the project in Backbone. You can create posts which uses nested forms and Paperclip to upload files. You can also favorite them, edit and delete your own posts. You can browse by categories or users and see the posts they've created and favorited. For styling I incorporated the Skeleton boiler plate and used Fontawesome icons.
